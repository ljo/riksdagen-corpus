# Known MPs
The catalog -- `catalog.csv` -- was compiled by Emil (@emla5688) and Magnus (@salgo60) using the  (Norberg et al, 1986, or Norberg and Asker, 1996) books and wikidata.

Bob (@BobBorges) cleaned the csv: cleaned strings containing commas (now a semi-colonsv file), aligned columns, filled in some missing info and split i-ort from the surname.

In theory, it contains all MPs for period (1867--2023???).




## "missing_" files

Files that start with `missing_` contain wiki_ids that are in the catalog but not represented in the `corpus/metadata/` files (file names correspond.)

These are generated by running the db unit test locally, with the `running_local` variable (line 16) set to True.




## "prioritized" wiki IDs

The `unique_missing_QIDs.json` file contains the list of wiki_ids that appear in each "missing_" file. In addition those "missing_" files in which the ID appears and ordered by N such "missing_" files. Thus, it's easy to prioritize "most absent" IDs by working from the top of the list, or by "missing_" type.. eg, all the IDs missing from `person.csv` first

Regenerate this file with `scripts/ls-missing-MP-QIDs.py`, which also prints info about duplicate QIDs and dummy QIDs (Q00FEL00).
